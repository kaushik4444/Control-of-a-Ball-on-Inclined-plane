# Control-of-a-Ball-on-Inclined-plane

Controlling a ball on an inclined plane using a PID controller with a servo motor as an actuator.

• Built a mathematical model and simulated it using Xcos Blocks.

• Created Closed-loop control with continuous & Discrete PID controllers. 

• Also worked on calibrating and controlling the real-time system with a PID controller.
